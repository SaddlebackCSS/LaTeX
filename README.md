 - When I asked friends who use LaTeX a lot in academia the following two books are often recommended. One free and one not, but both are supposed to be good and are on my todo list for between semesters:
  - ["The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX" (free PDF)](http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)
  - ["The LaTeX Companion" (free sample: $15-$40)](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780201362992/samplepages/0201362996.pdf)
